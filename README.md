![PHPSTan level](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHPStan-level%206-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)

eventHandler is a dotclear plugin to manage events (meetings, shows,...) on your blog.

The main developement has been made by Jc Denis <contact@jcdenis.fr> - https://chez.jcdenis.fr/
Many thanks to him for that great plugin. I will try to maintain that plugin so that it can be used in recent dotclear releases.

## Requirements

Of course, that plugin needs a dotclear blog engine.

## Static code analysis

Analysis is made using [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) :

```
$ composer phpstan
```

The analysis is made with level 6 but the idea is to increase that level and fix more and more possible issues.
